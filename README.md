#📚 BookCase – Library Management System (Java, Switch Statement)

Managing a library is often a challenging task, as it requires keeping track of books, their availability, and student borrowings. BookCase is a mini-project built in Java using a switch statement to demonstrate how a simple library management system can be designed.

This project is menu-driven and focuses on strengthening Java fundamentals like classes, objects, and switch-case logic.

##🚀 Why Build This Project?

Building this project helps in understanding:

How to design menu-driven applications using switch statements.

Managing data with classes and objects.

Implementing core features such as add, search, update, and display in a real-world scenario.

##✨ Features

The system supports the following operations:

🔴 Exit Application

📕 Add a New Book

📈 Upgrade Quantity of a Book

🔍 Search a Book

📚 Show All Books

🧑‍🎓 Register Student

📋 Show All Registered Students

📤 Check Out Book

📥 Check In Book

##🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple Java files, each responsible for a specific functionality:

File Name	Responsibility
Library.java	Main application containing the menu and execution flow.
book.java	Represents details of an individual book.
books.java	Manages the collection of books and related operations.
student.java	Represents details of an individual student.
students.java	Manages student records and borrowing activities.
